**Q2: What are examples of non-map learning problems?**  
**A:**  
- Text classification  
- Sentiment analysis  
- Recommendation systems  
- Fraud detection  
- Time series forecasting  
- Graph-based learning

## üß© Input Data Types

**Q3: What input formats are typically used in non-map models?**  
**A:**  
- Text (e.g., reviews, documents)  
- Tabular data (CSV, Excel)  
- Categorical and numeric features  
- Time series (sensor or financial data)  
- Graph structures (nodes and edges)

**Q4: How is the data represented for learning?**  
**A:**  
- Vectors (numerical or embedded)  
- Sequences  
- Adjacency matrices (for graphs)  
- Tensors for high-dimensional data
