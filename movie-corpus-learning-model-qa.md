## üéØ Objective

**Q1: What is the goal of a movie corpus learning model?**  
**A:** To use structured and unstructured movie-related data (e.g., titles, genres, scripts, reviews) for tasks like recommendation, classification, sentiment analysis, or dialogue generation.

**Q2: What types of tasks can be performed with a movie corpus?**  
**A:** 
- Genre classification
- Sentiment analysis on reviews
- Plot or script summarization
- Dialogue generation or completion
- Movie recommendation

## üì¶ Dataset Design

**Q3: What are common data sources for movie corpus?**  
**A:** 
- IMDb datasets
- TMDb API
- MovieLens (for ratings)
- Rotten Tomatoes
- Subtitle/script websites

**Q4: What are the key fields in a movie dataset?**  
**A:** 
- Title, year, runtime
- Genres, director, cast
- Summary/plot
- Script/dialogue
- Ratings and reviews

---

## üß™ Preprocessing

**Q5: How should text data (e.g., plot, script) be cleaned?**  
**A:** 
- Remove HTML tags, special characters
- Normalize whitespace
- Tokenize text
- Optional: lemmatization/stemming

**Q6: How can you handle multi-label genres?**  
**A:** Use binary multi-hot encoding or multilabel classification techniques.

## üìä Feature Engineering

**Q7: What are useful features for modeling?**  
**A:**
- TF-IDF or embeddings from plots/scripts
- Encoded genres, director/cast IDs
- Review sentiment scores
- User/movie interaction matrix for recommendations

**Q8: How do you create input for a recommendation model?**  
**A:** Create a matrix of user IDs and movie IDs with rating or interaction values (e.g., watched or not).

## üß† Model Types

**Q9: What models are used for genre classification?**  
**A:** 
- Logistic Regression, Random Forest
- CNN/RNN for text
- Transformers like BERT for plot/script classification

**Q10: What models are used for recommendation?**  
**A:** 
- Matrix Factorization (e.g., SVD)
- Collaborative Filtering
- Deep Learning models like Neural Collaborative Filtering (NCF)

---

## üìà Evaluation

**Q11: How to evaluate classification models?**  
**A:** Use accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC depending on the task.

**Q12: How to evaluate recommendation systems?**  
**A:** 
- RMSE for rating prediction
- Precision@K, Recall@K, MAP for ranked recommendation

---

## üîç Example Use Cases

**Q13: How to build a genre prediction model from plot summaries?**  
**A:** 
1. Preprocess plot text  
2. Convert to TF-IDF or BERT embeddings  
3. Train multilabel classifier (e.g., Logistic Regression, BERT)  
4. Evaluate with F1-macro

**Q14: How to recommend movies based on user history?**  
**A:** 
1. Build a user-movie interaction matrix  
2. Train with matrix factorization or deep learning model  
3. Predict top-K unseen movies for each user

## üß© Bonus Tips

- Consider fine-tuning BERT or GPT on movie scripts for generative tasks
- Handle data imbalance with SMOTE or class weighting
- Log model experiments with tools like MLflow or Weights & Biases
