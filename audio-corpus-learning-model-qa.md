## ‚úÖ General Overview

**Q1: What is an audio corpus?**  
**A:** An audio corpus is a large collection of audio recordings (e.g., speech, music, sound events) along with metadata and annotations, used for training or evaluating machine learning models.

**Q2: What tasks can be performed using an audio corpus?**  
**A:**  
- Speech recognition  
- Speaker identification  
- Emotion detection  
- Sound classification  
- Audio synthesis and generation

## üì¶ Dataset Composition

**Q3: What are common components of an audio corpus?**  
**A:**  
- Audio files (WAV, MP3, FLAC)  
- Transcripts or annotations (e.g., speaker labels, timestamps)  
- Metadata (language, gender, device)  
- Lexicon (for speech tasks)

**Q4: What are common public audio datasets?**  
**A:**  
- LibriSpeech  
- Common Voice (Mozilla)  
- UrbanSound8K  
- ESC-50  
- VoxCeleb

## üß™ Preprocessing

**Q5: How should raw audio be preprocessed?**  
**A:**  
- Resample to a consistent sample rate (e.g., 16kHz)  
- Normalize volume  
- Remove noise or silence  
- Trim or segment files into smaller chunks

**Q6: How to handle various audio formats?**  
**A:** Use libraries like `ffmpeg`, `pydub`, or `librosa` to convert and standardize audio formats and bitrates.

## üéöÔ∏è Feature Extraction

**Q7: What features are commonly extracted from audio?**  
**A:**  
- MFCCs (Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients)  
- Spectrograms  
- Chroma features  
- Zero-crossing rate  
- Energy and pitch

**Q8: Which Python libraries are used for feature extraction?**  
**A:**  
- `librosa`  
- `torchaudio`  
- `speechpy`  
- `pyAudioAnalysis`

## üß† Model Types

**Q9: What models are used for speech classification?**  
**A:**  
- CNNs (on spectrograms)  
- RNNs, LSTMs for temporal modeling  
- Transformers like Wav2Vec or Whisper  
- CRNN (hybrid CNN-RNN)

**Q10: What models are used for speaker recognition?**  
**A:**  
- x-vector and i-vector based systems  
- Siamese or Triplet networks  
- Pretrained models like ECAPA-TDNN

## üìà Training & Evaluation

**Q11: What loss functions are used for audio models?**  
**A:**  
- Cross-entropy (for classification)  
- CTC loss (for speech recognition)  
- Triplet loss (for speaker embedding)

**Q12: How to evaluate audio learning models?**  
**A:**  
- Accuracy, F1-score (for classification)  
- WER (Word Error Rate) for ASR  
- EER (Equal Error Rate) for speaker ID  
- Confusion matrix and ROC curves

## üîç Use Case Example

**Q13: How to build a speech emotion detection model?**  
**A:**  
1. Preprocess audio: normalize and segment  
2. Extract MFCCs  
3. Train an LSTM or CNN classifier  
4. Evaluate using F1-score and confusion matrix

**Q14: How to train a sound event classifier?**  
**A:**  
1. Convert audio to mel spectrograms  
2. Apply data augmentation (e.g., noise, pitch shift)  
3. Train CNN or CRNN  
4. Evaluate using precision and recall

## üß© Bonus Tips

- Use data augmentation for robustness  
- Balance classes to avoid bias  
- Apply voice activity detection (VAD) before training  
- Store preprocessed features to speed up training  
- Log experiments using tools like TensorBoard or MLflow
