## ‚úÖ General Overview

**Q1: What is a taste corpus?**  
**A:** A dataset that captures taste-related information such as flavor profiles, user preferences, sensory attributes, ingredient combinations, and reviews of food or beverages.

**Q2: What are common applications of a taste corpus learning model?**  
**A:**  
- Food or drink recommendation systems  
- Flavor prediction from ingredients  
- Taste classification  
- Recipe generation or transformation  
- Sensory evaluation automation

## üì¶ Dataset Composition

**Q3: What are typical components of a taste corpus?**  
**A:**  
- Item name (e.g., dish, beverage)  
- Ingredients  
- Flavor tags (e.g., sweet, salty, bitter)  
- Sensory attributes (e.g., mouthfeel, aroma)  
- User reviews and ratings  
- Nutrition and preparation metadata

**Q4: What are common data sources for a taste corpus?**  
**A:**  
- Food databases (e.g., FlavorDB, FoodKG)  
- Recipe sites and APIs  
- User-generated reviews  
- Sensory evaluation sheets

## üß™ Preprocessing

**Q5: How to preprocess ingredients and flavor text?**  
**A:**  
- Normalize ingredient names  
- Extract keywords from descriptions  
- Tokenize and embed flavor terms  
- Convert multi-label tags into binary encodings

**Q6: How to handle missing or subjective taste data?**  
**A:**  
- Use imputation techniques (e.g., KNN, mean fill)  
- Normalize user ratings  
- Encode subjectivity using reviewer confidence

## üîç Feature Engineering

**Q7: What features are useful for modeling taste preferences?**  
**A:**  
- Ingredient embeddings (e.g., Word2Vec for food)  
- TF-IDF or BERT on reviews  
- One-hot encoding for taste tags  
- Nutrition features (e.g., sugar, salt content)

**Q8: How to model relationships between ingredients and taste?**  
**A:**  
- Build co-occurrence graphs  
- Use knowledge graphs or embeddings  
- Apply matrix factorization or graph neural networks

---

## üß† Model Training

**Q9: What models are used for taste classification?**  
**A:**  
- Multilabel classifiers (Random Forest, XGBoost)  
- CNN/RNN on ingredient sequences  
- Transformer models (e.g., BERT fine-tuned on food reviews)

**Q10: What models are used for recommendation?**  
**A:**  
- Collaborative filtering  
- Neural matrix factorization  
- Content-based models using embeddings  
- Graph neural networks (GNNs)

---

## üìà Evaluation

**Q11: How to evaluate taste prediction models?**  
**A:**  
- Precision, Recall, F1 for multilabel classification  
- ROC-AUC for binary taste tag prediction  
- Mean Average Precision (MAP) for ranked lists

**Q12: How to evaluate recommendation systems?**  
**A:**  
- Precision@K, Recall@K  
- NDCG (Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain)  
- Hit Rate

## üç¥ Use Case Examples

**Q13: How to build a food recommendation system based on taste?**  
**A:**  
1. Collect user ratings and item taste features  
2. Create a user-item interaction matrix  
3. Train collaborative filtering or content-based model  
4. Serve top-N items per user

**Q14: How to classify dishes as sweet, spicy, or savory?**  
**A:**  
1. Preprocess ingredients and tags  
2. Encode as text or numeric features  
3. Train a multilabel classifier (e.g., Logistic Regression, BERT)  
4. Evaluate with F1-macro and label-wise metrics
