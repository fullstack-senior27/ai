# üóÉÔ∏è QA: Creating a Large Capacity Database

This QA document provides guidance on designing and building large capacity databases that support high volumes of data, efficient querying, and scalability. It covers architecture, optimization, and best practices.

## ‚úÖ General Concepts

**Q1: What is a large capacity database?**  
**A:** A database system designed to store and manage massive volumes of data‚Äîtypically in the range of terabytes to petabytes‚Äîwhile ensuring performance and reliability.

**Q2: What are typical use cases?**  
**A:**  
- Big data analytics  
- Logging and telemetry systems  
- Data lakes and warehouses  
- High-traffic web and mobile platforms  
- IoT and sensor data systems

## üèóÔ∏è Design Considerations

**Q3: What are key design principles for large databases?**  
**A:**  
- Data normalization for consistency  
- Partitioning/sharding for performance  
- Indexing for fast queries  
- Schema flexibility (for semi-structured data)  
- Horizontal scaling support

**Q4: What is the difference between vertical and horizontal scaling?**  
**A:**  
- Vertical: Upgrading hardware (CPU, RAM, SSD)  
- Horizontal: Adding more servers/nodes and distributing data

## üî¢ Database Types

**Q5: What types of databases are commonly used for large-scale systems?**  
**A:**  
- Relational: PostgreSQL, MySQL with partitioning  
- NoSQL: MongoDB, Cassandra, Couchbase  
- Columnar: Apache HBase, ClickHouse  
- Data Warehouses: Snowflake, BigQuery, Redshift  
- Time-Series: InfluxDB, TimescaleDB

## üîß Key Features

**Q6: What is data partitioning?**  
**A:** Dividing large tables into smaller, manageable parts (e.g., by date, region) to improve performance and scalability.

**Q7: What is sharding?**  
**A:** Distributing data across multiple databases or nodes to balance load and increase performance.

**Q8: What is denormalization and when is it used?**  
**A:** Reducing joins by duplicating data; used to optimize read-heavy workloads.

## üß† Optimization Strategies

**Q9: How to optimize read performance?**  
**A:**  
- Use indexes  
- Implement caching (Redis, Memcached)  
- Use materialized views  
- Use query optimization tools (EXPLAIN plans)

**Q10: How to optimize write performance?**  
**A:**  
- Use batch inserts  
- Use write-ahead logging (WAL)  
- Disable unnecessary indexes during bulk writes  
- Apply replication with async writes

---

## üõ°Ô∏è Reliability & Maintenance

**Q11: How to ensure high availability?**  
**A:**  
- Use replication and failover strategies  
- Distribute data across regions  
- Monitor with tools like Prometheus, Grafana

**Q12: How to manage backups in large databases?**  
**A:**  
- Incremental backups  
- Snapshots  
- PITR (Point-in-time recovery)  
- Off-site backup rotation

---

## üìä Monitoring & Tools

**Q13: What tools are useful for monitoring large DBs?**  
**A:**  
- pg_stat_statements (PostgreSQL)  
- Percona Toolkit (MySQL)  
- Prometheus + Grafana  
- Cloud-native tools (AWS CloudWatch, GCP Monitoring)

**Q14: What are recommended data ingestion frameworks?**  
**A:**  
- Apache Kafka  
- Apache NiFi  
- Airbyte  
- Logstash / Fluentd

## üß© Bonus Tips

- Normalize early, denormalize when scaling read throughput  
- Use compression to save disk space  
- Implement role-based access control (RBAC)  
- Keep schema evolution under version control  
- Document indexes and partition strategies
