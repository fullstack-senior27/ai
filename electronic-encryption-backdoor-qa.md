## üîë Common Encryption Methods in Electronics

**Q3: What are commonly used encryption methods in hardware devices?**  
**A:**  
- AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) for data encryption  
- RSA/ECC for secure boot and firmware signing  
- SHA-256 for data integrity  
- Secure Key Storage via TPM or Secure Enclave

**Q4: What is Secure Boot and how does it use encryption?**  
**A:** Secure Boot uses cryptographic signatures to verify firmware authenticity before execution. Only signed firmware is allowed to run.
